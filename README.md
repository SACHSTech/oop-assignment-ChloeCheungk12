![Fast Food Hierarchy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82913336/120874485-dd9f1280-c574-11eb-84b7-289b88e92f88.jpg)

## Summary
This diagram depicts the fastfood restaurant heirarchy. A fast food restaurant **has** an owner and employees (has-a relationship), both of which **are** persons (is-a relationship). Team members and supervisors **are** employees (is-a relationship).

The fastfood restaurant is one of the top levels of the  heirarchy, and has the ability to hire and fire employees, change the pay of its employees, etc. 

A person has attributes such as a name, an email and phone number. These attributes are shared by the owner and the restaurant's employees. However, the owner and the employees have some unique attributes. *E.g. only employees have employee numbers.* 

Team members and supervisors both share the attributes of an employee, but also have unique attributes. *E.g. Team members have an hourly wage, and supervisors are attributed a salary.*

When the program is run, the user (restaurant owner) has the ability to create employees, modify their information, view the employee list, pay the employees, etc., as they are overseeing the entire operation.
